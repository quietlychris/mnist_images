### MNIST dataset
This version of the MNIST handwriting data set in a `.png` image format. Each image is 28 x 28 pixels, is co-located with images of the same digit, and is named under the convention `$digit_$uniqueID.png`. The set is broken up in to 60000 train images, and 10000 test images. 

This is to provide a set of data that can be used to test out project structures that rely on simple directory structures for collecting and building training and validation data sets for machine learning models.
